# Hands-On-Deep-Learning-TensorFlow-and-Keras-for-Beginners
This repository contains a simple implementation of a single-layer neural network using TensorFlow and Keras. The project is designed to provide beginners with a hands-on experience of building and training a neural network model for classification tasks

### Key Features

1. Implementation of a single-layer neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.
2. Classification task with binary output (e.g., classifying images as cats or dogs).
3. Demonstrates fundamental concepts of deep learning, including model architecture, training, and evaluation.
